Constructing Knowledge Graph from text using Dependency Parsing

Knowledge Graphs are a way of storing data in a structured and organized way. It is a network of entities connected by relationships between them. Knowledge Graphs represent complex information in a logical form that makes it easier for machines to interpret the meaning of that data and perform tasks such as question answering, making recommendations, etc. Nowadays, Knowledge Graphs are used in a variety of applications including by search engines like Google. Given the emerging importance of Knowledge Graphs in today's technical world, it is important to understand how to create a knowledge Graph from raw textual data. This project explores the method to construct Knowledge Graphs from tweets, subsequently also exploring if a Knowledge Graph constructed from tweets provides any meaningful interpretation. Linguistic methods discussed in this project are named entity recognition and dependency parsing.
